## Hi there

Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm an associate professor at the Department of Communication Science at VU University Amsterdam. My specialization is **computational communication science**, which roughly means that I like to think about how we can use computers to enhance social scientific research and find new ways to approach the questions we're interested in. For instance, to automate content analysis research in order to handle the insane amount of communication data that is out there, and developing research infrastructure.

Anyway, my GitHub page is an eclectic mess of all sorts of repositories, but virtually anything I do in the area of programming is open-source. If you're looking for one of my projects and it isn't in here, it's probably just not ready for the light of day, and you should contact me if you're wondering what's keeping.
